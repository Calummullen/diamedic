                A Diamedic card is a compact, wallet-sized card with a unique QR
                code that links to your emergency medical details. It is
                designed specifically for diabetics and allows important
                information such as insulin types, dosages, and emergency
                instructions to be quickly accessed by first responders or
                members of the public.

                While the Diamedic card is designed to be durable and resistant
                to wear, it is not fully waterproof. We recommend keeping it in
                a safe place in your wallet to avoid exposure to excessive
                moisture.
