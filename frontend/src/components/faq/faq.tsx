              A Diamedic card is a compact, wallet-sized card with a unique QR
              code that links to your emergency medical details. It is designed
              specifically for diabetics and allows important information such
              as insulin types, dosages, and emergency instructions to be
              quickly accessed by first responders or members of the public.

              While the Diamedic card is designed to be durable and resistant to
